lowElikelihood_work2.py - unbinned likelihood on DS0
lowElikelihood_work2_v2.py - binned likelihood on DS0
lowElikelihood_work2_v3.py - binned likelihood on DS1-6; using Kris's energy resolution, residual non-linearity correction, and covariance matrix; float mean and sigma of 6.5 keV peak
justFit.py - prototype of lowElikelihood_work2_v3.py that only does the fit and not the profile likelihood analysis
lowElikelihood_work2_v4.py - binned likelihood on DS1-6; updated E resolution, no residual non-linearity; means of all peaks freely floated unconstrained
